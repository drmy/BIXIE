BIXIE
=====

This project is about the communication challenge with the changes to HomePort. HomePort is an intelligent home manage- ment system, which in the future is sup- posed to run on microprocessors. Home- Port uses XML in the communication be- tween different psysical devices. This for- mat uses a lot of space which becomes an issue, when microprossesors are intro- duced. This report contains a proposed solution to this problem. It is a HomePort optimized binary protocol, called BIXIE. The design of BIXIE, including the header and schema, is described in this report. Futhermore is the design of the compiler of BIXIE, which can both encode and decode valid XML files with a schema. The seman- tics for the BIXIE header is also defined in this report, but it is not implemented. The conclusion of this project is that BIXIE has almost flat compression rate, about 80%, and its performance is just as good as EXI with small data files and is twice as fast as the implementaion of OpenEXI, but when the data files get bigger EXI compresses the data files more than BIXIE. The im- plementaion of BIXIE could be optimized, and in the report is describes multiple ways of doing this, one of them being making the compiler one phase instead of two.
